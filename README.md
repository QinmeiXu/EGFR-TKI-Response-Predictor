The Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) - specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy has been proven to improve the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, about 5-30% of the patients still have rapid tumor progression after EGFR-TKI treatment. In this study, we develop promising multimodal machine-learning models to predict the rapid progression of patients to EGFR-TKI therapy for NSCLC patients. For the first time, we performed a broad range of multimodal integration, including electronic health records, computed tomography imaging, and next-generation genome sequencing profiles. We have identified key clinical, genetic, and radiomic prognostic indicators that are strongly responsive to the EGFR-TKI therapy. Our major findings demonstrate the key value of multimodal analysis for enhancing the individual care of patients with EGFR-positive NSCLC.

To enhance the accessibility and practical utility of our models, we have developed user-friendly interfaces for each of them, complete with data examples for each model. We hope that these tools will assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions and offer personalized therapeutic strategies for patients with EGFR-positive NSCLC.

We invite you to explore and utilize our models. Links to each model's interface are provided below:
